In the above Algorithm 2, we added a single noise parameter $\\xi_{\\epsilon}$ to the non-private estimate $f(X)$. Rather than adding noise to the aggregated $f(X)$, we could also add noise to each sensitive bit, $X_i$, individually. $$\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathcal{A}(X) = f(X + \\xi_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i + \\xi_{\\epsilon}^i ).$$ We will also go over this algorithm in more detail later in the lab.\n",
