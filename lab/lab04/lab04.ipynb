While you may talk with others about the labs, we ask that you **write your solutions individually and do not share your code with anyone other than your partner**. If you do discuss the assignments with people other than your partner please **include their names** in the cell below.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this problem we are trying to estimate the COVID infection risk in households. To do that we curate a list of K studies. Each study has an associated pair $(N_i, X_i)$ where $N_i$ denotes the number of susceptible individuals considered and $X_i$ is the number of them that became infected. In our modeling assumptions we assume that each susceptible person gets infected with probability $\\theta_i$. In epidemiology, this quantity is known as Secondary Attack Rate, or SAR for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're trying to do two things: \n",
    "1. We want to *combine* the information from all the studies, so we can get a better estimate of SAR than we would with any individual study on its own. \n",
    "2. We want to understand why the studies got different results: specifically, we'd like to figure out the regions with the *lowest* SAR, so that we can investigate what contributed to their relative success. In the other direction, we want to know which regions had the *highest* SAR, since they're likely the ones most urgently in need of intervention measures to help slow the spread.\n"

In this class, we'll focus primarily on *sampling* for approximate inference: this will be the topic of the next few lectures and next week's labs. In sampling-based approaches, **we don't even try to get the exact posterior: instead, we generate a bunch of samples from it, and use those to approximate the distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question you will get a taste for probabilistic programming using `PyMC`. Spend some time perusing the [documentation](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/learn/core_notebooks/pymc_overview.html), but don't worry if there are parts that don't make sense yet. The Quickstart guide is a useful starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using PyMC to run an algorithm called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which you'll learn about this week and next. We'll start by using the same model from `Question 1`, and compare the results from MCMC with the exact solutions we calculated above. Then, we'll add an extra parameter to the model and make things more complex: even though we can no longer compute our posterior in closed form, MCMC will still generate samples that we can use to estimate each $\\theta_i$."

    "First, let's get acquainted with the structure of PyMC, and show that methods of approximate inference are (in many cases) just as good as having access to the exact distribution. Just like in `Question 1`, we're still trying to estimate the SAR using the posterior mean; only this time, we'll be using PyMC to get an approximate answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So, how does PyMC work? What does it even do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, PyMC is just a number generator with extra steps. Given a *likelihood* and a *prior*, it simulates thousands of samples to create an empirical distribution that approximates the true posterior distribution. With those samples, we're able to calculate values of interest (such as the posterior mean, MAP, etc.), and create estimates of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we tell PyMC what our model looks like?\n",
    "\n",
    "As in any Bayesian parameter estimation problem, in order to find the posterior distribution, we must supply a **likelihood** and **prior**. To do this, we can instantiate [`Distribution`s](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/v3/Probability_Distributions.html) and their associated parameters to represent the random variables in our problem (you can take a look [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/v3/api/distributions.html) for a list of supported distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once defined, these distribution objects are like any random variable in statistics; you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and use mathematic operators on them (though sometimes you may need to use PyMC's own math operators). They can also function as either likelihoods or priors, depending on the parameters you feed them:\n",
    "1. If a `Distribution` object's parameters **do not** depend on other `Distribution` objects, these represent **priors**.\n",
    "2. If a `Distribution` object's parameters **do** depend on other `Distribution` objects, these represent **likelihoods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've specified a likelihood and prior, we have to consider our *data*; remember, the posterior describes the distribution of $\\theta$ given the data we observed! To do this, the `Distribution` class has a nifty little argument that we can pass in called `observed`. Using the `observed` argument, we can pass in our observed data to the random variable/`Distribution` object that corresponds to our observations, and let PyMC handle the rest!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now, try it out for yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the cell below, and **define the theta and X nodes to approximate the posterior distribution.** The PyMC website has documentation for defining variables according to the Beta and Binomial distribution. If you have no idea how to proceed, the PyMC Quickstart guide is a great place to start!"
